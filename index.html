                                <h2>Banks are so 90s! Say hello to FinTech.</h2>
                                <p class = "subheader">So what makes FinTech companies different from traditional banks? Simple, they 
                                    are built from the ground up with one and only goal. Make the movement of money from point A to 
                                    point B faster, hassle free and readily available - at your fingertips! </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class = "content">
                                <div class = "text">
                                    <p>In the process, they innovate and provide new services that relate to money. With many of these 
                                        solutions you can now save, pay, invest, fund and do pretty much everything that would normally 
                                        require a bank.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        No wonder technology giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and traditional banking giants 
                                        like Goldman Sachs are all moving into the FinTech dancefloor.
                                        <br>
                                        In the meantime, these companies offer ground-breaking solutions that traditional banks simply 
                                        cannot seem to keep pace with. For example, you can have accounts in multiple currencies, 
                                        electronic IBANs, some of them even cater for transactions in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin 
                                        and Ethereum. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The most important point of all is that any company dealing with money, is fully regulated and 
                                        licensed to operate as a payment institution. So rest assured, your money is safe.<br>
                                        <br>
                                        So is this the end of banks? Well, yes and no. You see, many traditional banks are now evolving 
                                        to meet the payment market needs for faster, simpler and flexible payment solutions. In the 
                                        process, traditional banking powerhouses are buying out major FinTech providers to keep pace. 
                                        As such, the value of FinTech companies is constantly on the rise. How much value you may ask? 
                                        Well, the global FinTech sector is forecasted to be worth $305 Billion by 2025, a forecasted 
                                        growth rate of 22% in 5 years!

                                        position. As an example, in 2020, Pfizer Stocks increased their value from $35 per share to 
                                        over $40. That translates to a yearly growth of over 14% which was the potential profit one 
                                        could have gained that year, and is well above any percentage any savings bank can offer.
